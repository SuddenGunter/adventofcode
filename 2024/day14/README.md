[Challenge link](https://adventofcode.com/2024/day/14).

How to run:

Put your data into 'data.txt' (in the same directory as this readme file).

```sh
mkdir images && mix run
```

Open the images/ folder and identify all files that contain a Christmas tree. The answer to Part 2 is the smallest number among the filenames of these images. For example, if the images/ folder contains the files 5.png, 1010.png, and 9999.png, then the answer to Part 2 would be 5.
